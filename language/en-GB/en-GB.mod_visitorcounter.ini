MOD_VISITORCOUNTER="VCNT - Visitorcounter"
MOD_VISITORCOUNTER_XML_DESCRIPTION="<h2><strong>VCNT - Visitorcounter</strong></h2><p>Small and fast visitorcounter module for Joomla! 3 with many features!</p><p>VCNT identifies and counts visitors by their IP addresses. Bots can be detected and excluded over the user agent header.</p><p>Note: No personal data is stored. The temporarily stored IP addresses can be converted into hashes (with the secret key as salt), which makes it impossible to draw any conclusions about the IP addresses.</p><p>All information and features: <a href="_QQ_"https://joomla-extensions.kubik-rubik.de/vcnt-visitorcounter"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"VCNT"_QQ_">VCNT - Visitorcounter</a></p><p>Please write a review in the JED: <a href="_QQ_"http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/extension/site-management/analytics/vcnt"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"VCNT Visitorcounter in the Joomla!

MOD_VISITORCOUNTER_ANONYMIZEIP="Anonymize IP Addresses"
MOD_VISITORCOUNTER_ANONYMIZEIP_DESC="Should the IP adress be anonymized? The last octet (8 bits) of the address will be replaced by 0. If it is an IPv6 address, then the last 2 groups (32 bits) are removed. It is merely impossible to re-associate the address. Disadvantage is, that access with IP-addresses only differing in their last octet (or last 2 groups), will not be detected as different accesses. It is also possible to create a hash value with the secret key as the salt of the IP address. Thus, each IP address is unique but (practically) cannot be recalculated (recommended setting - GDPR compliant)."
